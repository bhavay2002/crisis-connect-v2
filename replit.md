## Overview
Crisis Connect is a real-time disaster management and emergency response coordination platform. Its core purpose is to enhance data quality and streamline relief operations through rapid, GPS-tracked incident reporting with multimedia, crowd-sourced verification, and coordinated emergency responses. The platform utilizes AI for report validation, duplicate detection, and resource matching, with a mobile-first design for speed and clarity in emergency situations.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
**Framework**: React with TypeScript, using Vite.
**UI/UX**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS) following an Emergency Services Design Pattern and Material Design principles, prioritizing clarity, speed, and mobile-first accessibility.
**Design System**: Inter font, JetBrains Mono, HSL-based color system with light/dark themes.
**State Management**: TanStack Query (server state) + Zustand (client state via `client/src/store/`).
**Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing with `React.lazy` + `Suspense` for all 40+ pages (code splitting).
**Real-time Updates**: Singleton `WebSocketProvider` at `client/src/providers/WebSocketProvider.tsx` — ONE WS connection per session, subscribed to via `useRealtimeMessage(handler)` hook. Exponential back-off reconnect (2s → 30s).

**Feature-Based Architecture** (`client/src/features/`):
Each feature is a self-contained mini-application with its own types, services, hooks, store, and components. Pages are composition-only orchestrators.
- `crisis/` — types, crisis.api.ts, useCrisisRealtime/useCrisisActions/useCrisisStats hooks, crisis.store.ts (re-exports decisionStore), ActionPanel/CriticalBadge/IncidentTimeline/LiveCounter components
- `chat/` — types, chat.api.ts, useChatSocket/useChatActions hooks, chat.store.ts (Zustand for typing/optimistic), MessageBubble/PinnedBar/QuickActions/RoomList components
- `map/` — types, geo.api.ts, useMapFilters/useMapSync/useSelectIncident hooks, map.store.ts (re-exports commandCenterStore), IncidentPanel component; exports selectSelectedIncident/selectRoutes stable selectors
- `sos/` — types, sos.api.ts, useSOSRealtime hook
- `analytics/` — types, analytics.api.ts, useAnalyticsSummary/useMonitoringStats/useRiskPredictions hooks
- `roles/` — **RB-UX (Role-Based UX)**: RoleDashboard router, CitizenDashboard, VolunteerCommandDashboard, AuthorityCommandCenter, AdminRedirect, useCommandMode hook
- `index.ts` — top-level barrel

**AI Explainability Components** (`client/src/components/ai/`):
Plug-and-play decision intelligence panel used by Bloomberg/Datadog-style fintech dashboards.
- `AIExplainabilityPanel` — main component; drop `<AIExplainabilityPanel reportId={id} createdAt={ts} />` anywhere; fetches `/api/ai/explain/:id`
- `ConfidenceMeter` — animated gradient fill bar; color-coded by level (green ≥80% / yellow ≥60% / orange ≥40% / red <40%)
- `SignalRadar` — Recharts RadarChart showing 4-axis signal fusion (AI Urgency / Location / Repetition / Trust)
- `FactorBars` — stagger-animated bars; green = positive contribution, red = negative; sorted by |weight|
- `DecisionTimeline` — vertical stepper; `deriveTimeline()` synthesizes a reasoning chain from the raw explain API response
- Embedded in: `ReportDetails` (below report card, collapsed by default), `ExplainabilityPage` (full-page audit tool with decision list + panel)

**Role-Based UX** (`features/roles/`):
The `/` and `/dashboard` routes render a completely different product surface per role — not just hidden buttons, but separate layouts, workflows, and visual philosophies:

| Role            | Component                    | Philosophy                        |
|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| citizen / user  | `CitizenDashboard`           | SOS-first, minimal, calming       |
| volunteer / ngo | `VolunteerCommandDashboard`  | Task queue + accept/complete flow |
| admin / super   | `AdminRedirect → /admin`     | Operations control (existing)     |
| authority / gov | `AuthorityCommandCenter`     | Map-primary, dark command mode    |

- `useCommandMode` — detects critical incidents live; components shift to heightened visual state (darker, more contrast)
- `RoleDashboard` — lazy-loads only the role-specific component (no wasted bundle for other roles)
- `AuthorityCommandCenter` — forced dark, Leaflet map takes 2/3 of screen, 1/3 command panel with live incident feed + event timeline + dispatch actions

**Shared Layer** (`client/src/shared/`):
- `services/api.ts` — typed HTTP wrapper (get/post/patch/put/delete) over apiRequest
- `types/common.types.ts` — Severity, UserRole, LatLng, PaginatedResponse, ApiError
- `utils/format.ts` — timeAgo, shortDateTime, capitalize, slugToLabel, abbreviate
- `hooks/useVirtualList.ts` — `useVirtualList` (flat) + `useRowVirtualList` (grid) using @tanstack/react-virtual
- `hooks/useShallowSelector.ts` — Zustand multi-field selector with shallow comparison
- `hooks/useStableCallback.ts` — stable callback ref (useEvent pattern) — stops re-subscription loops
- `hooks/index.ts` — barrel exporting all shared hooks

**App Layer** (`client/src/app/`):
- `providers/index.ts` — barrel for WebSocketProvider, useWSContext, useRealtimeMessage
- `store/index.ts` — barrel for global Zustand stores (auth, realtime)

**Key Stores** (`client/src/store/`):
- `authStore.ts` — user session + role
- `realtimeStore.ts` — WS ping/unread count
- `decisionStore.ts` — active decision, event log (40 items), new report IDs highlight window
- `commandCenterStore.ts` — selectedIncident, routes (polylines), bidirectional map⇄panel sync

**Key Features**:
-   **Dashboards**: Includes a main dashboard, Volunteer Hub (demand-supply, resource management, report verification, AI insights), and Admin Dashboard (user management, report moderation, analytics export).
-   **Command Center Map** (`/map`): Operational split-pane layout — full-screen Leaflet map (left) + `IncidentPanel` (right, 380px). Clicking any marker hydrates the panel instantly via `commandCenterStore` (Zustand). `useMapEvents` flies the map to the selected incident. Severity-coded markers scale up when selected. Route polylines overlay on dispatch. Panel shows SLA timer, AI confidence bar, verification count, and 4 command buttons (Dispatch / Broadcast / Full Report / Upvote). Filters and heatmap/layer controls remain in a collapsible top bar.
-   **Interactive Map layers**: Heatmap overlay, demo shelters/evacuation zones/roads, timeline playback, filter controls for 13 disaster types — all preserved from previous version.
-   **Report Submission**: Multi-step form supporting 13 emergency types, severity, automatic GPS, multi-media upload (photos/videos/voice recordings to S3-compatible storage), and AI validation.
-   **Resource Management**: Systems for victims to request resources and volunteers to offer them, with AI-powered matching and status tracking.
-   **Notification System**: Real-time WebSocket-based notifications with priority levels and user preferences.
-   **Report Verification System**: Community upvote/downvote, consensus scoring combining votes, AI validation, and NGO/official confirmation for a trust score.
-   **Duplicate Detection & Clustering**: Non-AI-based detection using text similarity, location proximity, and time/type matching, with a Cluster Management UI.
-   **Image Classification**: Client-side AI disaster type detection using TensorFlow.js (MobileNet) for uploaded images.
-   **Predictive Modeling**: AI-powered disaster forecasting using historical patterns, real-time weather (OpenWeather API), and seismic activity (USGS API) to predict affected areas and assess risk levels.

## Spec §17-18 Features (v7.0 — Top 1% Research + Industry Grade Layer)

### §17.1 — Multimodal AI (Text + Voice + Image Fusion)
- **Architecture**: Three-signal weighted fusion — Text (40%), Voice transcript (30%), Image URL (30%) → single crisis score
- **`server/modules/ai/multimodal.service.ts`** — `analyzeMultimodal(input)` with GPT-4o vision + text. Falls back to keyword-based heuristic if OpenAI not configured. Returns: `crisisType`, `urgency` (0–1), `confidence` (0–1), `severity`, `explanation`, `fusionScores`, `fusedScore`, `requiresHumanReview`, `source`
- **Human review triggers**: confidence < 0.7, urgency ≥ 0.85, or severity = critical
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/ai/multimodal-analyze` — analyze single report (text + voice + imageUrl + location)
  - `POST /api/ai/multimodal-batch` — analyze up to 5 reports in one call
  - `GET /api/ai/multimodal-info` — fusion weights + review triggers + model info
- **Frontend**: `MultimodalPage.tsx` at `/multimodal-ai` (admin/authority/super_admin) — 3 signal input panels, fusion weight info cards, result display with score bars, signal breakdown grid, human review alert

### §17.2 — Crisis Simulation Engine
- **Architecture**: Synthetic event generator that injects real `disaster_reports` + `sos_alerts` rows tagged `[SIM]` into the live database. Fires `CRISIS_CREATED` EventBus events. Returns detailed performance metrics.
- **`server/modules/simulation/simulation-engine.ts`** — `runSimulation(config)` supports 7 scenarios × 4 intensities (low/medium/high/extreme). Intensity multiplier scales event count (1×/2×/4×/8×). Events are jitter-distributed around a base coordinate.
- **7 scenarios**: flood, earthquake, storm, mass_accident, epidemic, coordinated_attack, infrastructure_failure — each with distinct reportTypes array, defaultSeverity, estimatedAffected, and SOS injection ratio
- **Metrics returned**: totalEventsInjected, reportsCreated, sosAlertsCreated, peakSeverity, estimatedAffected, responseTimeSimMs, queueBacklog, failureRate, scenarioScore (0–100)
- **New table**: `simulation_runs` — scenario, location, intensity, eventCount, status enum, metricsData JSONB, injectedEventIds[], initiatedBy FK
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/simulation/scenarios` — all 7 scenarios with metadata
  - `POST /api/simulation/run` — run simulation (admin/authority/super_admin, max 20 events)
  - `GET /api/simulation/runs` — history (last 20)
  - `GET /api/simulation/runs/:id` — single run detail
- **Frontend**: `SimulationPage.tsx` at `/simulation` — scenario grid picker, location select, intensity selector, event count slider, metrics dashboard, run history list

### §17.3 — Digital Twin (City-Level Graph Model)
- **Architecture**: Bidirectional weighted graph of city nodes with Dijkstra-style BFS propagation. Crisis at node A → propagate across edges up to N hops (N = severity level). Finds nearest responders via Haversine distance + graph travel time.
- **`server/modules/digital-twin/digital-twin.service.ts`** — `simulateCrisisPropagation(impact, cityId)` + `seedDefaultCityModel(cityId)` 
- **Mumbai-inspired seed model**: 15 nodes — 2 hospitals, 2 fire stations, 2 police stations, 2 shelters, 2 road junctions, 2 bridges, 3 zones — + 15 edges with realistic travel times and congestion factors
- **Propagation output**: affectedNodes (with hop count, travel time, risk increase), nearestResponders (sorted by travel time, with availability = available/limited/overwhelmed), predictedResponseTime, riskSpread (contained/moderate/severe/catastrophic), bottlenecks (nodes with riskScore ≥ 60 in propagation path), estimatedAffectedPopulation, confidenceScore
- **New tables**: `city_nodes` (cityId, name, type enum, lat, lng, riskScore, capacity, metadata), `city_edges` (fromNodeId FK, toNodeId FK, distanceKm, travelTimeMinutes, roadType, congestionFactor)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/digital-twin/seed` — seed default city model (idempotent)
  - `GET /api/digital-twin/model?cityId` — full city graph (nodes + edges)
  - `POST /api/digital-twin/simulate` — propagation from a specific node
  - `POST /api/digital-twin/simulate-location` — auto-find nearest node to lat/lng and propagate
  - `PATCH /api/digital-twin/nodes/:id/risk` — update node risk score
- **Frontend**: `DigitalTwinPage.tsx` at `/digital-twin` — node grid with type-color badges, simulation panel, propagation result with responder list, bottleneck badges

### §17.4 — AI Decision Override (Human-in-the-Loop)
- **Architecture**: Every AI classification can be flagged for human review. Admins see a queue of pending decisions, can approve or override with new severity/type. Override writes back to the actual `disaster_reports` row.
- **Review trigger logic**: `confidence < 0.7 || urgency >= 0.85 || severity === "critical"` → `requiresHumanReview = true`, status = `pending_review`
- **New table**: `ai_overrides` — incidentId, incidentType, originalDecision JSONB, overriddenDecision JSONB, aiConfidence, aiUrgency, requiresHumanReview, status enum (pending_review/approved/overridden/auto_approved), overriddenBy FK, reason, notes, createdAt, reviewedAt
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/ai-overrides` — create override record for any AI decision
  - `GET /api/ai-overrides?status=` — list (filter by status)
  - `GET /api/ai-overrides/:id` — single record
  - `PATCH /api/ai-overrides/:id/review` — approve or override (writes back to disaster_reports if override)
  - `GET /api/ai-overrides/stats/summary` — total/pending/approved/overridden/autoApproved/overrideRate
- **Frontend**: `AIOverridePage.tsx` at `/ai-override` — 5-card stats bar, pending count alert, Pending Review / All Decisions tabs, review dialog with approve/override action, new severity/type selectors, reason textarea, full audit history

### §18 — Product Differentiation (Implemented)
CrisisConnect is no longer a reporting app. It is an **AI Intelligence Platform + Real-Time Infrastructure + Predictive Analytics + Human Control Layer**:
1. **AI-Powered Crisis Intelligence**: multimodal detection (text+voice+image), explainable AI decisions, human-in-the-loop governance
2. **Real-Time Coordination**: WebSocket dispatch, broadcast alerts, responder matching, live map
3. **Predictive Risk Engine**: weather risk scoring, digital twin propagation, simulation stress testing
4. **Platform Ecosystem**: developer API keys + webhooks, Prometheus metrics, circuit breakers, chaos engineering
